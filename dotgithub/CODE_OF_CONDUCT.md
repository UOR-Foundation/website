# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the UOR Foundation community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, colour, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

**Examples of unacceptable behaviour:**

- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Organisation Owners are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all UOR Foundation community spaces — repositories, Discussions, Issues, Pull Requests, and any other channels — and when an individual is officially representing the Foundation in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the Organisation Owners via the contact method specified in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) or by emailing the Foundation directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Organisation Owners are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.
