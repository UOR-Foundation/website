# UOR Foundation — Complete Agent Reference (v1.0.0)

> Universal Object Reference: one permanent, content-derived address per object. Verifiable. Composable. Universal.

---

## 1. Value Proposition

Digital content today is identified by location (URLs, database IDs, API endpoints). Location changes. Identifiers break. Systems fragment.

UOR replaces location-based identity with content-based identity. The address of an object is derived from what it contains. Same content → same address → across every system → forever. No registries. No coordination protocol. Mathematical certainty.

### What This Enables For AI Agents

| Capability | How UOR Delivers It |
|------------|-------------------|
| Deterministic reasoning | Same content always resolves to the same address. No ambiguity across sessions or systems. |
| Trustless verification | Verify any object mathematically via kernel-produced proofs, certificates, and derivation witnesses. |
| Universal composability | Compose objects from any source. The algebra guarantees lossless structural preservation. |
| Cross-system navigation | One coordinate space for all information. Navigate, query, and transform without adapters. |
| Persistent memory | Content-addressed objects survive platform migration, format changes, and system evolution. |

## 2. Quick Start (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Fetch the ontology
```
GET https://uor-foundation.github.io/UOR-Framework/uor.foundation.json
```
Returns the complete UOR type system in JSON-LD: 14 namespaces, 82 classes, 119 properties, 14 named individuals. Licensed Apache-2.0.

### Step 2: Understand the namespace structure
All 14 namespace IRIs resolve under `https://uor.foundation/`. Three classifications:

- **Kernel** (core algebra): `u:`, `schema:`, `op:`
- **Bridge** (connecting layers): `query:`, `resolver:`, `partition:`, `observable:`, `proof:`, `derivation:`, `trace:`, `cert:`
- **User** (application-facing): `type:`, `morphism:`, `state:`

### Step 3: Address and resolve content
Use the `u:` namespace for content-addressable identifiers. Each identifier is a Braille-encoded hash (glyphs U+2800–U+28FF, 6-bit encoding). Resolution flows through: type declaration (`type:`) → resolver (`resolver:`) → partition map Π : T_n → Part(R_n).

### Step 4: Verify computations
Every operation produces verification artifacts:
- `proof:` — Algebraic property verification
- `cert:` — Attestation certificates for transforms and isometries
- `derivation:` — Term rewriting witnesses (original → canonical form)
- `trace:` — Full execution traces with intermediate results and metrics

## 3. Foundational Axioms

Four axioms. No design choices. The minimal constraints for a universal, lossless, verifiable symbolic substrate.

1. **Unique Factorization.** Every object decomposes into exactly one set of irreducible components. Canonical representation guaranteed.
2. **Intrinsic Primes.** Indivisible building blocks determined by the algebraic structure itself, not by convention.
3. **Coherence Norms.** Measurable quantities (ring-metric, Hamming-metric, curvature, holonomy) that quantify structural faithfulness.
4. **Trilateral Coherence.** Every valid transformation must simultaneously preserve algebraic, geometric, and computational structure. The binding constraint that makes UOR universal and lossless.

## 4. Architecture (6 Layers)

| Layer | Name | Role | Key Namespaces |
|-------|------|------|---------------|
| 0 | Foundation | Axioms: unique factorization, intrinsic primes, coherence norms, trilateral coherence | — |
| 1 | Identity | Content-addressed symbolic addresses | `u:` |
| 2 | Structure | Geometric/algebraic composition and decomposition | `op:`, `partition:` |
| 3 | Resolution | Intent-based object lookup | `type:`, `resolver:`, `query:` |
| 4 | Verification | Mathematical proofs and attestation | `proof:`, `cert:`, `derivation:`, `trace:` |
| 5 | Transformation | Structure-preserving maps between representations | `morphism:`, `observable:`, `state:` |

Each layer inherits guarantees from the one below it. Layer 0 provides the mathematical foundation; Layer 5 provides the application interface.

## 6. Algebraic Structure

- **Ring substrate:** Z/(2^n)Z
- **Generators:** neg (additive inverse), bnot (bitwise complement)
- **Symmetry group:** D_{2^n} (dihedral)
- **Content addressing:** Braille glyphs U+2800–U+28FF, 6-bit bijection per glyph
- **Partition map:** Π : T_n → Part(R_n) divides the ring into Irreducible, Reducible, Units, Exterior

## 7. Use Cases For Agents

### Knowledge Graph Construction
Use UOR addresses as node identifiers. Content-addressed nodes are automatically deduplicated across sources. Compose graphs from heterogeneous data with algebraic guarantees.

### Verifiable Computation
Run computation → produce derivation witness → verify result against proof. Full chain of trust without relying on source reputation.

### Cross-Platform Data Integration
Same content from different APIs resolves to the same UOR address. Build unified views without reconciliation logic.

### Persistent Object Memory
Store UOR-addressed objects as long-term memory. Addresses survive platform changes. Retrieve and verify objects across sessions.

### Multi-Agent Coordination
Agents share UOR-addressed objects as a common language. No schema negotiation. Content identity is mathematical agreement.
