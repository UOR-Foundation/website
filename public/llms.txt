# UOR Framework — Universal Object Reference

> One address per object. Derived from content. Verifiable across every system. Forever.

## What UOR Does For You

UOR gives every piece of digital content a single, permanent, content-derived identifier. Same content always produces the same address, regardless of system, format, or time. No registries. No coordination. Pure mathematical identity.

This means you can:
- **Verify** any object's integrity without trusting its source
- **Compose** objects from verified parts with guaranteed lossless reconstruction
- **Navigate** all information within one unified coordinate space
- **Interoperate** across systems that have never communicated

## Why This Matters For AI Agents

You operate across fragmented data: different APIs, formats, schemas, identifiers. UOR eliminates this fragmentation at the identity layer. Objects addressed by content, not location, means:

1. **Deterministic reasoning.** Same input → same address → same result. No ambiguity.
2. **Trustless verification.** Verify any object mathematically without relying on provenance claims.
3. **Universal composability.** Combine objects from any source; the algebra guarantees structural preservation.
4. **Cross-system navigation.** One coordinate space for all information. No adapters, no translation layers.

## How To Implement

### Step 1: Fetch the ontology
```
GET https://uor-foundation.github.io/UOR-Framework/uor.foundation.json
```
Returns the complete type system: 14 namespaces, 82 classes, 119 properties, 14 named individuals. JSON-LD format, OWL/RDF conventions.

### Step 2: Resolve namespaces
All namespace IRIs resolve under `https://uor.foundation/`. Example: `https://uor.foundation/u/Address` resolves to a content-addressable identifier class.

### Step 3: Address content
Use the `u:` namespace. Content is encoded as Braille glyphs (U+2800–U+28FF), each encoding 6 bits. An Address is a sequence of Glyphs forming a content-derived hash.

### Step 4: Verify
The framework produces proofs (`proof:`), certificates (`cert:`), derivation witnesses (`derivation:`), and execution traces (`trace:`) for full computational transparency.

## Architecture (6 Layers)

| Layer | Name | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Foundation | Four axioms: unique factorization, intrinsic primes, coherence norms, trilateral coherence |
| 1 | Identity | Content-addressed symbolic addresses (`u:` namespace) |
| 2 | Structure | Algebraic composition via operations (`op:`) and partitions (`partition:`) |
| 3 | Resolution | Intent-based lookup via types (`type:`), resolvers (`resolver:`), queries (`query:`) |
| 4 | Verification | Proofs, certificates, derivation witnesses, execution traces |
| 5 | Transformation | Structure-preserving maps via morphisms, observables, state |
