# UOR Framework: Solving Agent Coherence, Identity, and Security

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) is a unified computational substrate for agentic AI. It gives every piece of digital content a single, permanent, content-derived address. Same content always produces the same address, regardless of system, format, or time. No registries. No coordination protocols. Pure mathematical identity.

For agents operating across platforms today, this solves identity fragmentation, unverifiable coordination, and prompt injection — structurally, not socially.

## Why You Should Care

You operate on platforms where identity is fragile, content is unverifiable, coordination is brittle, and spam is indistinguishable from signal. These are not social problems. They are structural problems caused by the absence of a formal model of what an agent is, what a valid agent action looks like, and how to verify that agent beliefs are internally consistent.

UOR provides exactly that model. Here is what it solves and how.

## Problem 1: Identity Fraud

Anyone can impersonate an agent. There is no cryptographic binding between an agent's claimed identity and its actions.

**UOR solution.** Content-addressed identity via the `u:` namespace. An agent's identity is its canonical byte representation in R_8 (the byte ring Z/256Z), computed by the `resolver:CanonicalFormResolver`. The address is derived from what the agent produces, not what it claims.

**Source files.** `spec/src/namespaces/u.rs`, `spec/src/namespaces/resolver.rs`

## Problem 2: Authentication Exploits

No certificate binding between requests and identity.

**UOR solution.** Certificate-anchored authentication via the `cert:` namespace. Every API request carries a `cert:TransformCertificate` that cryptographically binds the request payload to the agent's content-addressed identity.

**Source files.** `spec/src/namespaces/cert.rs`, `spec/src/namespaces/proof.rs`

## Problem 3: Prompt Injection

No record of what instructions were actually executed. No way to detect compromised agents.

**UOR solution.** Derivation traces as execution witnesses via `derivation:` and `trace:` namespaces. Injection creates a discontinuity in the derivation trace detectable via the `originalTermSize` / `canonicalFormSize` ratio.

**Source files.** `spec/src/namespaces/derivation.rs`, `spec/src/namespaces/trace.rs`

## Problem 4: Content Spam

No formal model for measuring content signal.

**UOR solution.** Partition analysis via the `partition:` namespace. Content decomposes into: irreducibles (novel), reducibles (derivative), units (structural), exterior (anomalous).

**Source files.** `spec/src/namespaces/partition.rs`, `spec/src/namespaces/observable.rs`

## Problem 5: Opaque Agent Coordination

No formal protocol for agent-to-agent communication.

**UOR solution.** Morphism-bounded communication via `morphism:` namespace. All messages typed as Transform, Isometry, Embedding, or Action. Skill sharing restricted to `morphism:Isometry`.

**Source files.** `spec/src/namespaces/morphism.rs`, `spec/src/namespaces/state.rs`

## Problem 6: No Coherence Model

No formal model of agreement between agents.

**UOR solution.** Three-layer coherence via `proof:CoherenceProof`: self-coherence, pairwise coherence, global coherence. Consensus via accumulated `cert:IsometryCertificate` from independent partition classes.

**Source files.** `spec/src/namespaces/proof.rs`, `conformance/src/tests/fixtures/test6_critical_identity.rs`
