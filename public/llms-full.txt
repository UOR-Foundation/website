# UOR Foundation — Complete Reference for AI Agents

> This document provides comprehensive information about the Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework for agentic AI systems.

## Organization

The UOR Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing a universal data standard for the semantic web, open science, and frontier technologies.

## UOR Framework Overview

Universal Object Reference (UOR) is a universal, lossless coordinate system for information. It assigns every piece of digital content a unique and permanent identifier based on what it contains (content-based), not where it is stored (location-based).

### Core Principle
When two systems hold the same content, they resolve to the same identifier — enabling direct verification, reliable reuse, and reduced integration overhead. By replacing fragmented, location-based systems with shared, content-based identity, UOR strengthens trust between systems.

## Namespace & Ontology

### Canonical Namespace
- IRI: `https://uor.foundation/u/`
- Prefix: `u:`
- Space: kernel

### Classes

#### u:Address
- IRI: `https://uor.foundation/u/Address`
- Subclass Of: `owl:Thing`
- Description: A content-addressable identifier represented as a Braille string. Each Address uniquely identifies a piece of content via its Braille-encoded hash.
- Properties:
  - `glyph` (Datatype, Functional): The Braille string representation. Domain: u:Address, Range: xsd:string
  - `length` (Datatype, Functional): Number of Braille glyphs. Domain: u:Address, Range: xsd:nonNegativeInteger

#### u:Glyph
- IRI: `https://uor.foundation/u/Glyph`
- Subclass Of: `owl:Thing`
- Description: A single Braille cell encoding 6 bits of an address. The bijection between Braille cells and 6-bit values is the foundational encoding.
- Properties:
  - `codepoint` (Datatype, Functional): Unicode codepoint (U+2800–U+28FF). Domain: u:Glyph, Range: xsd:nonNegativeInteger
  - `byteValue` (Datatype, Functional): 6-bit integer value (0–63). Domain: u:Glyph, Range: xsd:nonNegativeInteger

## How to Interact with the UOR Framework

1. **Read the Ontology**: Start with the namespace docs to understand the data model.
2. **Explore the Repository**: The GitHub repo contains the canonical specification, schemas, and reference implementations.
3. **Use the Namespace**: Reference UOR content using the `u:` prefix and `https://uor.foundation/u/` IRI.
4. **Contribute**: Submit issues, PRs, or join the Discord community.
5. **Extend**: The namespace supports extensions — see the framework documentation for the extension model.

## For Tool-Using AI Agents

- The UOR Framework repo is the source of truth for all specifications.
- Content-addressable identifiers can be resolved via the `u:` namespace.
- The ontology follows OWL/RDF conventions and can be processed by standard semantic web tooling.
- Extensions to the namespace follow the pattern documented in the framework repository.
