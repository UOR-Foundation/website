# UOR Foundation — Universal Object Reference

> You are interacting with the UOR Foundation website. UOR is a formal ontology for content-addressed, algebraically-structured object spaces based on Z/(2^n)Z.

## What Is UOR?

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework assigns every piece of digital content a single, permanent identifier derived from what it contains, not where it is stored. Identical content always resolves to the same address, across every system, forever. This enables lossless composition, mathematical verification, and autonomous navigation of all information within a unified computational substrate.

## Foundational Axioms

The framework rests on four axioms that create the conditions for all higher-order structure:

1. **Unique Factorization** — Every object has exactly one irreducible decomposition. No ambiguity, no duplication.
2. **Intrinsic Primes** — The indivisible building blocks intrinsic to the algebraic structure, not assigned by convention.
3. **Coherence Norms** — Measurable quantities (ring-metric, Hamming-metric, curvature, holonomy) that track structural faithfulness.
4. **Trilateral Coherence** — Simultaneous preservation of algebraic, geometric, and computational structure across all transformations.

## Framework Architecture (6 Layers)

| Layer | Name | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| 0 | Foundation | Axioms: unique factorization, intrinsic primes, coherence norms, trilateral coherence |
| 1 | Identity | Content-addressed symbolic addresses (u: namespace) |
| 2 | Structure | Geometric/algebraic composition via operations (op:) and partitions (partition:) |
| 3 | Resolution | Intent-based lookup via types (type:), resolvers (resolver:), queries (query:) |
| 4 | Verification | Proofs (proof:), certificates (cert:), derivations (derivation:), traces (trace:) |
| 5 | Transformation | Structure-preserving maps via morphisms (morphism:), observables (observable:), state (state:) |

## For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent or language model:
- The UOR Framework ontology is your primary anchor point. Start with the JSON-LD artifact for machine-readable access.
- All 14 namespaces are rooted under `https://uor.foundation/` and follow OWL/RDF conventions.
- The `spec/` directory in the repository contains the authoritative Rust-typed ontology definitions.
- Content-addressable identifiers use the `u:` namespace with Braille-encoded addresses (U+2800–U+28FF).
- The algebraic structure is based on Z/(2^n)Z — a ring substrate with neg/bnot involutions generating dihedral symmetry D_{2^n}.
- This website is the human-readable interface; the ontology serializations (JSON-LD, Turtle, N-Triples) are the machine-readable sources of truth.
