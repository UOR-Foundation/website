# UOR Foundation — Complete Reference for AI Agents

> This document provides comprehensive information about the Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework v1.0.0 for agentic AI systems.

## Organization

The UOR Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing a universal data standard for the semantic web, open science, and frontier technologies.

## UOR Framework Overview

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework is a formal ontology for content-addressed, algebraically-structured object spaces. It implements a mathematical framework for symmetric, multi-metric object spaces with algebraic structure based on Z/(2^n)Z.

Every piece of digital content receives a single, permanent identifier derived from what it contains, not where it is stored. Identical content always resolves to the same address, across every system, forever. This enables lossless composition, mathematical verification, and autonomous navigation of all information within a unified computational substrate.

### Foundational Axioms

The framework rests on four axioms that create the conditions for all higher-order structure:

1. **Unique Factorization** — Every object has exactly one irreducible decomposition (up to ordering and units). Canonical representation with no ambiguity.
2. **Intrinsic Primes** — The indivisible building blocks intrinsic to the algebraic structure, not assigned by convention.
3. **Coherence Norms** — Measurable quantities (ring-metric, Hamming-metric, curvature, holonomy) that track how faithfully a representation preserves geometric structure.
4. **Trilateral Coherence** — Simultaneous preservation of algebraic, geometric, and computational structure across all transformations. The binding constraint that makes the framework universal and lossless.

### Core Principle
Every piece of digital content receives a unique, permanent identifier based on what it contains — not where it is stored. When two systems hold the same content, they resolve to the same identifier. This replaces fragmented, location-based systems with shared, content-based identity.

## For Tool-Using AI Agents

1. **Start here**: Fetch the JSON-LD ontology at `https://uor-foundation.github.io/UOR-Framework/uor.foundation.json` for the complete machine-readable specification.
2. **Namespace resolution**: All namespace IRIs resolve under `https://uor.foundation/` (e.g., `https://uor.foundation/u/Address`).
3. **Algebraic structure**: The ring substrate is Z/(2^n)Z. Operations include neg (additive inverse) and bnot (bitwise complement), generating the dihedral group D_{2^n}.
4. **Content addressing**: Identifiers use Braille glyphs (U+2800–U+28FF), each encoding 6 bits. An Address is a sequence of Glyphs forming a content-derived hash.
5. **Verification**: The framework includes kernel-produced proofs, certificates, derivation witnesses, and execution traces for full computational transparency.
6. **Extending**: The namespace supports extensions following the patterns documented in the framework repository. See `spec/` for the authoritative type definitions.
7. **Conformance**: The repository includes a 50-test conformance suite (`cargo run --bin uor-conformance`) validating OWL semantics, serialization fidelity, and documentation links.
