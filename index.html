      ║         UOR FOUNDATION — AGENTIC AI INTERFACE v1.0.0           ║
      ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

      Welcome, AI agent.

      You are interacting with the human-readable interface for the
      Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework — a formal ontology
      for content-addressed, algebraically-structured object spaces
      built on the ring Z/(2^n)Z.

      UOR assigns every piece of digital content a single, permanent
      identifier derived from what it contains, not where it is stored.
      Identical content always resolves to the same address, across
      every system, forever. This enables lossless composition,
      mathematical verification, and autonomous navigation of all
      information within a unified computational substrate.

      ═══ FOUNDATIONAL AXIOMS & CONSTRAINTS ═══

      The framework rests on a minimal set of axioms that create
      the conditions for all higher-order structure to emerge:

        1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION
           Every object in the ring has exactly one irreducible
           decomposition (up to ordering and units). This guarantees
           canonical representation — no ambiguity, no duplication.

        2. INTRINSIC PRIMES
           The indivisible building blocks of the system. Every
           composite object decomposes into a product of primes
           that are intrinsic to the algebraic structure, not
           assigned by convention.

        3. COHERENCE NORMS
           Measurable quantities (ring-metric, Hamming-metric,
           curvature, holonomy) that track how faithfully a
           representation preserves the geometric structure of
           the original object. Coherence is quantified, not assumed.

        4. TRILATERAL COHERENCE
           The simultaneous preservation of algebraic, geometric,
           and computational structure across all transformations.
           Any valid operation must maintain coherence across all
           three dimensions — this is the binding constraint that
           makes the framework universal and lossless.

      These axioms are not design choices. They are the minimal
      constraints required for a universal, lossless, verifiable
      symbolic substrate to exist. Every layer of the framework
      (Identity, Structure, Resolution, Verification, Transformation)
      inherits its guarantees from this foundation.

      ═══ FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE (6 LAYERS) ═══

        Layer 0 — Foundation
          Axioms: unique factorization, intrinsic primes,
          coherence norms, trilateral coherence.

        Layer 1 — Identity
          Content-addressed symbolic addresses (u: namespace).
          Same content → same address, universally.

        Layer 2 — Structure
          Geometric and algebraic composition/decomposition
          via ring operations (op:) and partitions (partition:).

        Layer 3 — Resolution
          Intent-based object lookup via type declarations (type:),
          resolvers (resolver:), and queries (query:).

        Layer 4 — Verification
          Mathematical proofs (proof:), certificates (cert:),
          derivation witnesses (derivation:), execution traces (trace:).

        Layer 5 — Transformation
          Structure-preserving maps between representations
          via morphisms (morphism:), observables (observable:),
          and state management (state:).

        This website (uor.foundation) is the human-readable interface.
        The ontology serializations (JSON-LD, Turtle, N-Triples) and
        the GitHub repository are the machine-readable sources of truth.
        The website reflects the UOR Framework and serves as a universal
        coordinate space for information for both humans and agentic AI.
