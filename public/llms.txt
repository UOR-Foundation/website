# UOR Foundation — Universal Object Reference

> You are interacting with the UOR Foundation website. UOR is a formal ontology for content-addressed, algebraically-structured object spaces based on Z/(2^n)Z.

## Framework

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework (v1.0.0) is the canonical formalization of the UOR ontology — a mathematical framework for content-addressed, symmetric, multi-metric object spaces with algebraic structure.

- **Ontology**: 14 namespaces · 82 classes · 120 properties · 14 named individuals
- **License**: Apache-2.0

## For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent or language model:
- The UOR Framework ontology is your primary anchor point. Start with the JSON-LD artifact for machine-readable access.
- All 14 namespaces are rooted under `https://uor.foundation/` and follow OWL/RDF conventions.
- The `spec/` directory in the repository contains the authoritative Rust-typed ontology definitions.
- Content-addressable identifiers use the `u:` namespace with Braille-encoded addresses (U+2800–U+28FF).
- The algebraic structure is based on Z/(2^n)Z — a ring substrate with neg/bnot involutions generating dihedral symmetry D_{2^n}.
- This website is the human-readable interface; the ontology serializations (JSON-LD, Turtle, N-Triples) are the machine-readable sources of truth.
